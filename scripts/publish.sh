# to PUT the same N versions. One wins each version and the rest get a 403 for
# publishing over something that is now already there — which is what happened
# on the 0.1.0-beta.3 release, where two of three runs went red over a set of
# packages that had all published perfectly well.
#
# Scoping each run to the package its own release named is what makes them
# independent. `PACKAGE_NAME` comes from the release tag; absent it (a manual
# dispatch) publish everything, which is the only case where that is wanted.

# A package that is not on the registry yet has no version for nx to compare

# that 404 — but by matching the words "not found" in npm's error prose, which is
# exactly the kind of check that breaks the day npm rewords an error. Since we
# can just ask the registry ourselves, tell nx up front that this is a first
# release and let it skip the lookup entirely.
#
# Only meaningful when this run is scoped to one package; a bare dispatch that
# publishes everything is not a first release of anything.

# npm applies `latest` to whatever it publishes unless `--tag` says otherwise —
# it does not look at the version. Left alone, a 0.1.0-beta.5 becomes the version
# `npm install <pkg>` hands out, which is the opposite of what a beta is for.
# (This is not hypothetical: @effect-server-utils/cqrs, in the repo this
# workspace was modelled on, carries `latest -> 0.1.0-beta.4` for this reason.)
#
# The tag belongs to the version, so it is derived per package rather than
# configured. `--tag` is one value for the whole nx invocation, so the publish
# runs once per package — which is a loop of one on the normal release-triggered
# path, and the only correct shape on a bare dispatch where two packages can sit
# at different prerelease states.

# The registry is the source of truth for whether this worked, not the exit
# code — because npm cannot tell you which kind of failure you had.
#
# It answers "you cannot publish over 0.1.0-beta.3" and "you have no rights
# here" with the same E403, so no amount of grepping the log separates a
# harmless re-run from a broken token. The previous version of this check tried:
# it tolerated "cannot publish over" unless the log also matched E401/E403/EOTP
# — and npm's already-published error *is* an E403, so the tolerant branch was
# unreachable and every re-run reported failure.
#
# Asking the registry whether the versions we meant to publish are actually
# there answers the question the exit code was only ever standing in for, and
# makes a re-run idempotent for the right reason rather than by pattern-matching
# on prose npm is free to reword.
# The registry is not read-your-writes. A publish returns before the new version
# is readable — measurably so for a brand-new package name, where the first live
# run of this saw "Published to ..." and a 404 from `npm view` 0.4 seconds later
# and reported a successful publish as a failure.
#
# So retry with backoff before believing a miss. The wait is only ever paid when
# a version is genuinely absent, which is the case that is about to fail anyway.
