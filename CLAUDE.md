# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

An Nx + pnpm monorepo publishing architecture-policy tooling: a policy written as one manifest of
the repository (`architecture.config.mjs`), enforced by an oxlint plugin and a CLI. Four packages,
all under `packages/`:

- **`@goodbones/core`** (`packages/core`) — the manifest schema, the evaluators for the five
  per-file families (`imports`, `exports`, `members`, `surface`, `structure`) and the `graph` family
  (cycles, orphans, transitive reach), the `limits` ratchets, the ports a language pack implements,
  a fake per port under `@goodbones/core/testing`, and `loadPolicy`. It names no language.
- **`@goodbones/typescript`** (`packages/typescript`) — the TypeScript language pack: facts read
  through the TypeScript parser, specifiers resolved through `unrs-resolver`, behind the core's
  `Language` port.
- **`@goodbones/cli`** (`packages/cli`) — the `architecture` bin: `check`, `baseline`, `coverage`,
  `explain`, `facts`. Being the one host that sees every file at once, it is where the graph family
  is evaluated.
- **`@goodbones/oxlint`** (`packages/oxlint`) — the plugin: five oxlint rules over the same manifest.

Both hosts depend on the core and the pack and never on each other. `website/` is an Astro + Starlight
docs site deployed to GitHub Pages at <https://dataquail.github.io/oxlint-utils>.

**The repository enforces its own architecture with the packages it publishes.**
`architecture.config.mjs` at the root is a real policy over `packages/`, wired into `.oxlintrc.json` as
the `architecture` JS plugin, so `pnpm lint` fails on a layering violation. That makes the policy the
packages' largest test: a change that breaks lowering or resolution breaks the lint run here first.
Every family is in it, deliberately — `imports` and `structure` for the layering, `members` for
"`core/` and `domain/` never touch the file system" and "a port member is camelCase", `exports` for
"a live adapter is constructed only at the composition root" and "no namespace import or `export *`
between tiers", `surface` for "no default exports, no `export *`", `graph` for no cycles, no dead
modules, "the pure tiers reach no adapter", "the core reaches no other package" and "the two hosts
never reach each other", and `limits` with both adoption ceilings at zero and coverage floors at the
numbers the day they were written — so a family whose extraction quietly narrows breaks this lint
run, not a user's.

## Things that will bite you

**Every package's tsconfigs reset `paths` to `{}` on purpose.** oxlint and Node load the emitted
JavaScript with bare imports, and tsc does not rewrite path aliases on emit — a `@/…` specifier that
typechecks would be a runtime `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Relative specifiers run within a package; across
packages a bare `@goodbones/core` runs, resolved through the pnpm workspace link to the sibling's
`build/`. The `paths` in `tsconfig.base.json` are for the root typecheck only. Each package's
`tsconfig.src.json` and `tsconfig.build.json` carry a `references` entry per dependency so `tsc -b`
builds the dependency's declarations first — and `references` is not inherited through `extends`, so
both files repeat it.

**A cross-package import goes through the barrel.** `@goodbones/core` is `packages/core/src/index.ts`
and `@goodbones/core/testing` is the fakes; the root policy refuses a deep import into a sibling's
`src/`, as a consumer outside the repo would find one refused by the `exports` map. Tests alias the
bare names to `src` (`vitest.shared.ts`); `TEST_DIST=1` points them at `build/esm`.

**`packages/oxlint/build/esm/plugin.js` is the plugin entrypoint**, the package's default export (and
its `./plugin` subpath). `packages/cli/build/esm/main.js` is the `architecture` bin. Both are in the
`exports`/`bin` maps, so renaming or moving those source files is a breaking change.

**The plugin must be built before any lint.** oxlint imports JavaScript, so a stale `build/` enforces a
stale policy while still linting green, and a missing one fails every package's lint with "Failed to
load JS plugin". Two things close that: the `lint` script builds every package first, and `nx.json`'s
`targetDefaults.lint` declares `dependsOn: ["build", { projects: ["@goodbones/oxlint"], target:
"build" }]`, so linting `core` on a clean checkout builds the plugin (and, through `^build`, the core
and the pack) before oxlint starts. Depending on a project's own build alone is what passed locally
and failed in CI.

**`tsconfig.resolve.json` is not part of any build.** It exists so the architecture plugin can resolve
specifiers, and it mirrors `tsconfig.base.json`'s `paths` _without_ the trailing extension those carry —
a mapped target is a template, so a `.ts`-suffixed mapping would make `pkg/x.js` look for `x.js.ts`.
Changing `paths` in one file and not the other is how rules silently stop resolving.

**Adding a layer means adding a node to `architecture.config.mjs`, and so does adding a package.** A
new folder under a `src/` that no node governs trips the taxonomy-root catch-all rather than being
quietly unpoliced; a new package under `packages/` is a new `~/<name>/` node with its own import
allowlist, plus a `paths` pair in `tsconfig.base.json` and `tsconfig.resolve.json`, an entry in
`vitest.workspace.ts`, and a reference in the root `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json`. Before
trusting a rule you just wrote, plant the violation it exists to catch and watch `pnpm lint` fail — the
probe check proves a rule _can_ fire, not that it fires on what you meant.

**Imports use explicit `.js` extensions.** `moduleResolution` is `NodeNext` and the package is ESM —
`import { x } from "./thing.js"` referring to `thing.ts` is correct, not a mistake to "fix".

**`oxlint` and `@effect/tsgo` move together.** The `prepare` step runs `effect-tsgo patch --oxlint`,
and that patch targets one exact oxlint version, so a bump is the pair (`1.81.0` with `@effect/tsgo`
`^0.40.0`). Do not go below 1.78.0: 1.77.0's language server panics building the "disable this rule"
quick-fix for any JS-plugin diagnostic (oxc #25278), so the architecture rules ran in CI and never
surfaced in the editor. `.vscode/` points the editor at `oxc.oxc-vscode` for the same reason.

**`no-redeclare` is off on purpose.** From oxlint 1.79.0 the rule reports TypeScript declaration
merging — `export const X = Schema.Struct(…)` beside `export type X = …`, which is how every schema in
`src/domain/` is written. Upstream closed it as not planned (oxc #25936). A real redeclaration is
TS2451, and the compiler owns it.

**`effect` is an exact dependency** (`4.0.0-beta.94`), pinned again in the root `pnpm.overrides`. Effect
4 betas are mutually incompatible; bumping it is a coordinated breaking change.

**`references` is not inherited through `extends`**, so `tsconfig.build.json` and the root
`tsconfig.build.json` repeat what the plain `tsconfig.json` already lists.

## Conventions

- **Prettier**: double quotes, `printWidth: 100`, semicolons. (Note this differs from most dataquail
  repos — it matches the upstream these packages were extracted from.)
- **oxlint**, not ESLint. Local rules live in `scripts/lint-rules/` and are loaded as an oxlint JS
  plugin under the `local/` prefix. The config extends `@effect/tsgo`'s recommended preset, which is
  where the `effecttsgo/*` rules come from.
- **Conventional commits** are enforced by commitlint and drive `nx release` version bumps.
- **Nx targets** are declared in each `project.json` and delegate to the package's own npm scripts, so
  `pnpm --filter … run build` and `nx build …` do the same thing. Each `package.json` sets
  `"nx": { "includedScripts": [] }` so Nx does not also infer targets from the scripts.
- **Docs are namespaced per package.** `website/src/content/docs/architecture-rules/**` belongs to this
  package; a second library gets its own directory and its own sidebar group rather than being folded
  into this one.

## Architecture notes

`@goodbones/core` is laid out hexagonally, and the layering is the thing to preserve:

- `src/domain/` — the manifest schema, the error types, the `Violation` and its line-independent
  fingerprint. No I/O.
- `src/core/` — the pure evaluators (`imports`, `exports`, `members`, `surface`, `structure`, `graph`,
  `coverage`, `baseline`, `patterns`). Given facts, they return violations; they never read a file.
- `src/manifest/` — compiling the manifest tree down to flat, resolved rules (`lowerManifest`).
- `src/load/` — `loadPolicy`: decode, lower, compile and probe a manifest the host has already
  read, with the language packs and the `FileSystem` the host hands in. Language-neutral; the
  resolver and the extractor it returns route each file to the scope's language.
- `src/ports/` — the `FileSystem`, `ModuleResolver`, `FactExtractor` and `Language` ports.
- `src/infrastructure/` — a fake per port (exported as `@goodbones/core/testing`; tests drive them),
  and the three things the core does on this host without a language: the live file system, the
  walker, and reading the manifest file.

The other three packages sit around it:

- `@goodbones/typescript` implements the ports for one language and assembles them into
  `typescriptLanguage()`. Its extractor is what the CLI reads every file through and what the
  loader parses authored probes with. Only the two hosts' `config-loader.ts` construct it; the
  core never imports it (a `reach` rule in the repo policy says so).
- `@goodbones/cli` and `@goodbones/oxlint` — the two hosts. Both answer to the same core,
  deliberately, so an alpha oxlint plugin API is not a single point of failure. The plugin reads
  oxlint's tree instead of the pack's extractor, and `packages/oxlint/src/parity.test.ts` holds the
  two to one answer — it lives in the plugin because it is the plugin's contract with the pack.

Two properties are load-bearing and pinned by tests:

- **Every compiled rule carries a probe** generated from its own node path, and the plugin **refuses to
  load** if any probe fails. A rule that has drifted into matching nothing is a load-time error, not
  something a separate script might notice later. A `members`, `exports` or `surface` rule may carry
  an authored `probe: { source }` instead, parsed at load — the only way to prove a rule fires on a
  declaration shape, since a synthetic probe never meets a parser.
- **The baseline is a ratchet, not a suppression list.** Entries are keyed by fingerprint, and fixing a
  violation fails the build until its entry is removed, so the floor only rises.
- **The graph family is CLI-only, by design.** The plugin sees one file at a time; `architecture check`
  builds the import graph (parsing each file once) and is a superset of the plugin, not a mirror.
  Both adapters compile and probe graph rules at load, so a vacuous one fails `oxlint` too.

## Releasing

`nx release` with `projectsRelationship: "independent"`. Push to `main` → version + tag + GitHub
release; creating that release triggers the npm publish from `packages/<name>` (not a `dist/`
subdirectory — the manifest's `files` is what narrows the tarball). `updateDependents: auto` bumps
`cli` and `oxlint` when `core` or `typescript` changes. See `RELEASE.md`.

**`main` releases only packages the registry already knows.** The release job asks npm about each
package and passes the existing ones to `nx release --projects`; a never-published package goes through
First Publish, deliberately. And `updateDependents: auto` versions a package's dependents with it — an
unreleased dependent gets a stable patch bump and a tag with no publish — so a first publish names the
whole set (`core`, `typescript`, `cli`, `oxlint`) in one run; the preflight refuses otherwise.

**A package that has never been released does not go through that path.** It has no git tag and no
registry version to derive from, so it is bootstrapped by the **First Publish** workflow
(`workflow_dispatch` → `scripts/first-publish.sh`), which passes nx's `--first-release` and refuses any
package that is already on the registry. After that one run the package is normal.

**`--preid` is passed once, on the first publish, and never again.** Once a package's current version
is a prerelease, nx resolves every subsequent bump as `prerelease` on its own, so the ordinary flow
keeps cutting betas with no flag anywhere. Leaving beta is therefore a deliberate
`nx release minor` — there is nothing to unset — which is the property you want from a "not ready yet"
state. Don't add a preid to `on-push.yml` trying to make betas stick; they already do.

**The npm dist-tag is derived from the version, not configured** (`scripts/dist-tag.mjs`, used by both
publish scripts). npm applies `latest` to whatever it is given unless `--tag` says otherwise and never
looks at the version, so an untagged beta becomes what `npm install` resolves to — which is exactly
what happened to `@effect-server-utils/cqrs` (`latest -> 0.1.0-beta.4`).

**`.npmrc` sets `provenance=true` unconditionally, and npm errors rather than degrades without a
trusted CI to attest from.** Any publish outside Actions — including a Verdaccio rehearsal — needs
`NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=false`, and gives up the attestation to get it.
